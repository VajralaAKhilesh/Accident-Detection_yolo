# Accident-Detection_Yolo
This project implements an Accident Detection system using deep learning techniques in Python. The model is designed to detect road accidents from video frames using computer vision, aiding in the development of smart surveillance systems and emergency response solutions.

# Overview
With increasing numbers of vehicles on the road, the risk of accidents also rises. Early accident detection can significantly reduce response time and save lives. This project utilizes deep learning to process and analyze video input to determine if an accident has occurred in a given scene.

# Tools Used
